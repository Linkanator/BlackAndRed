game, two players each start with 12 pieces.

● Players will be able to move pieces by clicking on the tiles they would like to move from and the tile they would like to move to.

● They can then make their way towards the
other side of the board, until they reach the opponent's end of the board and get crowned. 
With a crowned piece, a player will be able to move both forward and backward.

● The rules to playing BlackN'Red are as follows:

- Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward    the opponent).
- A piece making a move not involving a jump may move only one square.
- A piece making only one jump leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. 
- Multiple jumps are allowed during a single turn. They do not have to be in a straight diagonal line.
- When a piece is jumped over, it is removed from the board.
- When a piece reaches the opponent's side of the bord, it is crowned. 
- Crowned pieces are also limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward. 
- Crowned pieces may combine jumps in several directions, forward and backward, on the same turn.
